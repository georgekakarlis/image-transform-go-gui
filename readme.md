this is a side small project to use as a personal tool. i created it as i didnt found any secure or safe tool to transform images to webp for my cooking blog website so that I can save some space on the server. It uses Go - Fyne to create a GUI and the webp library to transform the images. 

It is simple to use, just put the folder where the images are and in whichfolder you want to save the webp images and run the app. it is gonna get the job done in no time.
